#Active Region Detection Parameters (some from higgins et al. 2011)
#Some are new for HMI and not discussed in the paper... to be published...
#
#This version is specifically for generating simple SMART2 AR detections
#for HMI rebinned to 1kx1k
#(not producing mag properties, core detections, etc)
#
#The detection parameters smooththresh & magthresh are determined by
#running PLOT_HMI_CROSSCAL_RESID.PRO to determine the optimal values
#to match the MDI detections 201004-201008 using the MDI parameter
#file: ar_param_run2.0.20130828.combined.txt
#See talk: SMART2_THRESHOLDS

#These may be used if a FITS header is missing
hmi_dx; 0.50430298; F; arcsecs per px in x direction
hmi_dy; 0.50430298; F; arcsecs per px in y direction
hmi_rsun; 945.87290; F; radius of Sun in arcsecs
#
#Switches
doproject; 0; I; do the detection and area calculation in a projected equal shape or area space (projects and then unprojects)
docosmicray; 1; I; do cosmic ray detection and fill in with NaN
domedianfilt; 0; I; process the magnetogram using median smoothing to help with noise (seems to cause noise detections at the limb!)
#
#Magnetogram Processing
cosmicthresh; 5000.; F; A hard threshold for detecting cosmic rays
medfiltwidth; 3.; F; the width of a box to use to perform median filter on magnetogram
#
#Projection Parameters
threshlon; 90.; F; the deg. to LOS to go out to for the projection
projscl; 1.5; F; the fractional increase/decrease in image size for the projected image
#
#HMI SMART detection based on pixel size determined from map structure and supergranule physical size
#smooth and mag thresholds determined by minimising the difference in overlap between HMI and MDI detections
smoothphys; 16.; F; Physical gaussian smoothing HWHM in Mm. The radius of a characteristic supergranule
smooththresh; 15.0; F; a segmentation threshold used in processing magnetograms (for 1kx1k gaussian smoothed; determined from plot_hmi_crosscal_resid.pro by comparing HMI and MDI detection masks)
magthresh; 350.0; F; a secondary segmentation threshold (for MDI) used to find all flux fragments in an image
#
#HMI Core detection: use PSLs and strong field to detect the flaring cores of ARs
strongthresh; 200.0; F; a segmentation threshold to detect strong field fragments which are then dilated to form the 'cores' of ARs.
polethresh; .99; F; imbalanced fraction of total area covered by a given (+ or -) polarity (=abs(npos-nneg)/abs(npos+nneg)), below which, the detection will be considered multipolar (core passes the flux balance test)
#
#Physical Constants and Handy Numbers
cmpmm; 1d16; F; Number centimeters in a mega meter
nan; -NaN; F; handy filler value for not-a-number situations
#
#Not Used Currently
#smoothpole; 5.; F; Threshold for polarity blob counting. smoothing radius/FWHM in pixels for AR prior to polarity counting
#threshpole; .1; F; fraction of total area covered by a given (+ or -) polarity, below which, the detection will be considered monopolar
#gradthreshw; 50.; F; Gradient threshold (for PSL detection?)
#gradthreshs; 150.; F; Gradient threshold for strong polarity separation lines?
#mdi_noisethresh; 70.0; F; a noise threshold used in processing MDI magnetograms
#pdatamag; ~/science/procedures/chole_detect/data/mag/; A; a path pointing to the source data directory for the magnetogram input images
